Hello, and welcome to SlakResQ.

This is a USB-bootable live Slackware distribution, based on Tomas Matejicek's
Linux Live Kit.

This is built with the same live kit used to build Slax. Whereas Slax is a
fairly minimal distribution, which can be customized by installing packages,
SlakResQ is designed to be a more or less full (yet modular) Slackware
install out of the box. It also has some of the same features of Slax -- such
as the ability to preserve changes to the filesystem between reboots, even on
USB sticks with FAT filesystems.

As the name implies, this was originally designed as a 'rescue' boot disk, for
repairing crashed systems. However, as a full (depending on how this
particulary copy was built) Slackware installation, it has all the power of
Slackware available to it.

SlakResQ Tweaks
---------------

While this is more or less a 'stock' Slackware install, a few amenities have
been added:

* Several default boot configurations will now boot directly into X without
  updating inittab
* When starting X with startx (or a display manager that doesn't offer
  selection of sessions), the default session is a script that tries to pick
  the best session available based on what is installed (which can change from
  boot to boot depending on bundle selection)
* When starting for the first time, the root password will be set to a random
  password, a regular user will be created with the same password, and a
  message will be displayed with login details at the first login prompt. If X
  is installed, the new user will be automatically logged in, with a similar
  message displayed. Both messages will disappear once either account password
  has been changed (or a new user added)

Installing onto USB
-------------------

If you're using a computer with an EFI BIOS (who isn't nowadays?) you can
simply copy the entire contents of this folder to the root of a USB stick, and
your computer should be able to boot from it. You may need to activate a menu
on boot to tell the computer to boot from the USB stick; this procedure varies
between manufacturers.

If you're trying to boot off an older machine without EFI support, you'll need
to go into the slakresq/boot folder and run bootinst.bat (on Windows) or
bootinst.sh (on Linux) to install a bootloader to the USB stick. This may
generate an error about not being able to move the EFI folder; this is normal,
as the EFI folder has already been moved into the appropriate place.

Booting from CD/DVD is currently not supported.
